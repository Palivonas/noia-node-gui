# Introduction

Currently runs with:

- Angular v5.2.5
- Angular-CLI v1.6.4
- Electron v1.8.2
- Electron Builder v20.0.4

With this sample, you can :

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally, install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.


If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can desactivate "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Manage your environment variables

- Using local variables :  `npm start` or `cross-env ENV=local npm start`
- Using development variables :  `cross-env ENV=dev npm start`
- Using production variables  :  `cross-env ENV=prod npm start`

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run ng:serve`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:linux`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system |
|`npm run electron:windows`| On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems |
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Mac |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser (WITHOUT HOT RELOAD ACTUALLY...) ? You can do it with `npm run ng:serve`.
Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.

## How to install native modules

Three ways to install native modules:

### The Easy Way

The most straightforward way to rebuild native modules is via the
[`electron-rebuild`](https://github.com/paulcbetts/electron-rebuild) package,
which handles the manual steps of downloading headers and building native modules:

```sh
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild

# Every time you run "npm install", run this
./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild

# On Windows if you have trouble, try:
.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd
```

### The npm Way

You can also use `npm` to install modules. The steps are exactly the same with
Node modules, except that you need to setup some environment variables:

```bash
export npm_config_disturl=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell
export npm_config_target=0.33.1
export npm_config_arch=x64
export npm_config_runtime=electron
HOME=~/.electron-gyp npm install module-name
```

### The node-gyp Way

To build Node modules with headers of Electron, you need to tell `node-gyp`
where to download headers and which version to use:

```bash
$ cd /path-to-module/
$ HOME=~/.electron-gyp node-gyp rebuild --target=0.29.1 --arch=x64 --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell
```

The `HOME=~/.electron-gyp` changes where to find development headers. The
`--target=0.29.1` is version of Electron. The `--dist-url=...` specifies
where to download the headers. The `--arch=x64` says the module is built for
64bit system.
